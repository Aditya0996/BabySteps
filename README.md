# Baby Steps
#### _Learning writing made easier_

## About This Project
This project was developed as part of the Object Oriented Design course. It showcases the application of object-oriented principles and design patterns learned during the course.

## Description
- In the era of digitalization, the vision of Baby Steps is to help preschoolers learn how to write alphabets and numbers in an easy-to-use and rewarding method.
- The application aims to make learning accessible to all children.
- The objective is to create a global learning tool seated at the cross-section of technology, interactive content, and personalized learning methods to help children become active self-learners.
